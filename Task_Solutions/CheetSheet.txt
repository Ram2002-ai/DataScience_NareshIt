| what is mean by full stack ( backend+frontend) 
| shared course content 
what are main topic coverd under the course 
| who can join this course
shared qr code to join the whatsapp community chanell 
| course duration and fees & enrollment proces
| what would be salary for fresher, experience
| discussed question & answer 
|what system configuration required Multiple job opening you can applied after learning this course
|we talked about ai mock tools for interview
| AI Knowledge graph"


**1/3/2026	Demo session-2	**

"about placement -- 40 min 
roadmap for 5-6 months
| project ( live or capstone)  -- domain always live 
BFSI -- banking, fiannce, service, insurance cerfificaiton you will get after compelte the course  lot of student had query 
| we discussed on them college session 
| real time working profession session online & offline please try to thing that you comring organization "


1/5/2026	Partial demo + classes	

"work with python numbers == integer  
introduce google colab 
| ide -- integrated development environement user can write the code, get the bug & fix the bugs 
compile time error - the error happen user side ( syntax error) 
bodmas rule
| arithmetic operator python has name name is called (variable = object = identifier)syntax ( variable = value) value as datatypes "
 
1/6/2026	pyton intoduction

"python - backend, frotend, scripting, cloud integration, db, scripting, everywhere
python is object oriented programing 
| dynamic ( it can datatype automatcally ) 
platform independent
| python has bunch of library
|data analysis | ml library | gen ai library | agentic ai library

Rules to define python variable -- does not start with digit 
no special character is allowed except underscore 
case sensitive , keywords can never be variable | 35 keywords 
when you guyes learned all the 35 keyword python si completed 
keyword also called reserved word 
python varianbce completed | yesterday i saw fresher offer "


1/7/2026	Python datatypes 

"function ends with () , function without argument & function with argument 
argument === parameter 
| type() -- give which dtatype 
| id() - address of the memory lcoation for the variable 
print() -- print the statement
| when you wanted to multiple line print() 
|type error 
| introduce to datatypes -- int, float, string, bool, complex 
int -- value without decimal is called int 
float -- value with decimal is called float | in float it accept only e letter 
e or E -- both are allowed | e0 -- 1.0 | e1 - 10.0 | e2 - 100.00 
bool - True or False | must be wrte T or F  "


1/8/2026	python datatypes & ollama introduction	

"complex -- complex we use very less in entire ml, ai, gen ai. 
One of the datatype where we will be using in math application 
complex format - 1 + 2j (1 - real part, 2 is called imaginary j is called squre root of -1 )
string -- '' "" "" & ''' ''' ' & "" "" we wil be used for single line comments 
'' ''' - multiline comments | we list of llm model 
chatgpt - open ai , gemma -- gemini, deepseek - deepseek | llama - meta
claude - antropic | grok - xai 
chatgpt -- we write chatgpt.com website to get information 
we build own custom llm using ollama frame work "


1/9/2026	Pyhton operator 
"basic operator we are completed
arithmetic, assgnment, logical, unary, relational 
print() - without arg, with arg () multiple parameer we can pass 
one more time about ollama model 
cmd prompt -- do not install more then 2 model or else system will hand 
deep seek model 4gb 
| system will hang 
another student got place offer direnctly linkedin
print() with format strint | f string method"


1/10/2026	basic python 
"advanced string | help() -- prompt will appear to exit the prompt - quit
string question we solved 
string indexing 
| python indexing counts from 0 
python indexing 2 part -- forward indexing & backward indexing 
forward indexing begins with 0 
backward indexing begins with -1 "


1/12/2026	string indexing 	
"python index begins with 0 | left to right | backward indexing right to left 
step indexing 
| more on datastructure 
scaler -- number | vector -- collection of scaler 
array -- collection of vectors | tensor -- collection of arrays
package vs module vs function 
structure data = supervised learning = labeld data ( technologgy which deals with structure data -- machine leanring )
unstrcuture data = unsupervised learning ( tech which deal with unstrcuture data -- AI 
reinforcemnt ( model can interaact with environment) generative ai & agentic ai "


1/19/2026	python data structure

-- List 	"datatype -- user define only one value 
datastructure -- user define more then one value 
ds using c | ds using java | ds using python -- ds using python is easyer then anything else 
list == [], append() copy(), remove() pop() -- index wise elimination 
insert(), extend(), insert() -- pass 2 argument 
workin on list "


1/20/2026	List & Tuple 

"list indexing, slicing 
forward indexing, backward indexing, forward slicing, backward slicing, step slicing
sort() apply only when you pass same dataype 
if you declare different datatypes then sort will wont work 
reverse() 
parameter ==system given own parameter 
user change systems parameter is called hyperparameter 
() 
| list -- [] | tuple has only 2 function ( index & count)
list is mutable & tuple is immutable | list membership 
enumerate - gives pair items of the list "


1/21/2026	Set 	
indexing & slicing not allowed
add() will work :- add the element in sets
